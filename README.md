# Simple-SpaceShooter-on-AGK-BASIC-
Very simple core mechanics of spaceshooter game, that created on AppGameKit, used BASIC

So, this is my first game. It was created on AppGameKit, using BASIC language.
It has only one enemy, and kinda static background (exc of stars, that created manually through code).


HOW TO RUN IN EDITOR:
Just download AppGameKit (via Steam or official site) and add project into editor.
